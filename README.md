# Class-Register
This code is meant to demonstrate what a school would use to log each student's punctuality.
To add more names/edit existing ones, one must go into the code and manually change the name in the list.
When ran, the code will display a name in the list and ask if they are present (y/n).
Once all students are accounted for, the code will display the total amount of present compared to absent students.
